Problem Statement: Predicting California housing prices using specific features

Machine Learning model: Clustering, Random Forest Classifier

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/achyutanandaparida/dataset%20from%20%20house%20sales%20in%20king%20county,%20usa

Target: House Price

Features:

    * # of bedrooms
    * # of bathrooms
    * # of square foot living
    * # of square foot lot
    * # of floors
    * water front
    * view


Preprocessing Data:

    * Download dataset from csv
    * Create tables in database with CSV (SQL)
    * Read tables into Pandas
    * Clean up data if needed

Outline of machine learning model:

    * Predict price of home based on features such as # of rooms, lot size, location, etc.
    * Group housing prices based on related featurs into clusters
    * Use 3D plot to visualize the breakdown of features of each cluster and display what house price group they fall under (prediction)
