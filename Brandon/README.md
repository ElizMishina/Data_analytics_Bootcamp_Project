Problem Statement: Predicting California housing prices using specific features

Machine Learning model: Clustering, Random Forest Classifier

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedzaky01/housing

Target: House Price

Features:

    * Lot size
    * Total # of rooms
    * Total # of bedrooms
    * Location
    * Price of houses sold in same area
    * Age of the home
    * Rating of school district

Preprocessing Data:

    * Download dataset from csv
    * Create tables in database with CSV (SQL)
    * Read tables into Pandas
    * Clean up data if needed

Outline of machine learning model:

    * Predict price of home based on features such as # of rooms, lot size, location, etc.
    * Group housing prices based on related featurs into clusters
    * Use 3D plot to breakdown features of each cluster and display what house price group they fall under (prediction)
