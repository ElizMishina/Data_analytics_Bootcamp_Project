# Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project
## Segment 1
The topic we selected, the reason for selecting this topic, and the questions we wish to answer are in the [main Branch ReadMe file](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/README.md).

The two sources we are using are [House sales in King County, USA](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/kc_house_data.csv) and [United states zipcodes](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/zip_code_database.csv) the original link to these files are in the [main Branch ReadMe file](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/README.md).

In this segment we worked together to pick out the topic, and orginize the project. At this time my only job was to keep the [main Branch ReadMe file](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/README.md) organized as well, as keeping the [GitHub](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project) orginized.


## Segment 2
In this segment I will be starting to put together the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tu8kpEW_eMj6sY7mHG4yKu1wUKrHQQwbZeIkFiv13WE/edit#slide=id.g6c3f460955_0_120). It will contain:
* selected topic
* reason why it was selected
* description of the data source
* questions we hope to answer
* descripition of the data exploration phase of the project
* description of the analysis hase of the project

In this segment i will continue to geep the [Main GitHub Page](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project) orginised.
There are/will be files for each part of the project:
* [Resource](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/tree/main/Resources)
* [DataBase]()
* [Machine Learning Model]()
* [Dashbord]()
As well as the [ReadMe](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/README.md) file, where there are links to everyone's idividual ReadMe file as well as a brief over view of what everyone is doing in each segment.

In this segment I will be starting to put together the DashBoard. At this point I am unsure if we will be creating a website or using Tableau story board. However, there is a [Storyboard](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zPjLQjZFv1hgx527TvCYcwXP_tY3SkvMWfn8anygJrc/edit#slide=id.g4dfce81f19_0_45) in google drive.
