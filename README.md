The topic we selected, the reason for selecting this topic, and the questions we wish to answer are in the [main Branch ReadMe file](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/README.md).

The two sources we are using are [House sales in King County, USA](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/kc_house_data.csv) and [United states zipcodes](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/zip_code_database.csv) the original link to these files are in the [main Branch ReadMe file](https://github.com/ElizMishina/Data_analytics_Bootcamp_Project/blob/main/README.md).
